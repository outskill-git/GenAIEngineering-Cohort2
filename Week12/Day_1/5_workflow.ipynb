    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Modules**:\n",
    "    - `os`: Provides functions to interact with the operating system.\n",
    "    - `load_dotenv` from `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the system environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - The `load_dotenv()` function is called to load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clearing Conflicting Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - A list of environment variables (`env_vars_to_clear`) is defined, which includes `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `OPENAI_API_BASE`.\n",
    "    - For each variable in the list, the code checks if it exists in the environment. If it does, it prints a warning message and deletes the variable from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setting New Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to the value of the `OPEN_ROUTER_KEY` environment variable.\n",
    "    - Both `OPENAI_API_BASE` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are set to `'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commented-Out Code**:\n",
    "    - There is an alternative block of code (commented out) that clears the same environment variables and sets `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the value of the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This code ensures that conflicting environment variables are removed and sets up the required environment variables for interacting with the OpenRouter API. It provides flexibility to switch between different API keys and base URLs by modifying the `.env` file or uncommenting the alternative block of code.\n"

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell defines a custom workflow class `TwoAgentWorkflow` that utilizes two agents, a `Researcher` and a `Writer`, to perform a collaborative task. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "    - `Agent`: Represents an individual agent capable of performing specific tasks.\n",
    "    - `Workflow`: A base class for defining workflows.\n",
    "    - `RunResponse`: Represents the response of a workflow run.\n",
    "    - `DuckDuckGo`: A tool used by the `Researcher` agent for web searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Definition**:\n",
    "    - `TwoAgentWorkflow` inherits from `Workflow` and defines a collaborative workflow involving two agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agents**:\n",
    "    - **Researcher**:\n",
    "      - Uses the `DuckDuckGo` tool to search for information.\n",
    "      - Instructions: \"Search for information and gather facts.\"\n",
    "    - **Writer**:\n",
    "      - Processes the research data and writes a summary.\n",
    "      - Instructions: \"Take research data and write a clear summary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflow Logic**:\n",
    "    - The `run` method accepts a `topic` as input.\n",
    "    - **Step 1**: The `Researcher` agent searches for information about the given topic using its `run` method.\n",
    "    - **Step 2**: The `Writer` agent generates a summary based on the research data provided by the `Researcher`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Usage**:\n",
    "    - An instance of `TwoAgentWorkflow` is created and assigned to the variable `workflow`.\n",
    "    - The `run` method is called with the topic \"electric vehicles.\"\n",
    "    - The result of the workflow is printed, displaying the summary generated by the `Writer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This workflow demonstrates how multiple agents can collaborate to perform a task, such as researching a topic and summarizing the findings. It highlights the modularity and reusability of agents in a workflow.\n"

      "The recent research highlights several key aspects of the electric vehicle (EV) landscape:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In the UK, EVs have made significant inroads, now accounting for more than one in every 20 car miles driven. Battery electric cars under three years old have averaged 10,054 miles last year, showcasing their growing usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. While EVs considerably cut harmful emissions compared to conventional vehicles, a recent study points out they may introduce some less severe environmental impacts, underlining the complex environmental trade-offs involved in their adoption.\n",

      "3. In the U.S., federal rebates for EV purchases will soon expire, with a $7,500 rebate for new EVs and a 30% or $4,000 credit for used EVs ending by September’s conclusion. This impending change might significantly affect consumer buying patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The U.S. Postal Service is modernizing its fleet as part of a $40 billion plan, which includes integrating new electric vehicles for letter carriers and establishing a new mail sorting center in Huntington Station.\n",

      "5. Consumer Reports has released a guide to the 10 best deals on electric vehicles, emphasizing the available rebates and significant savings, crucial for prospective EV buyers.\n",
